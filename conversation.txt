So far as I am aware of there is no ai currently out there that can help with remembering tasks or managing inventory. From kitchen to pc room. Warrentee dates, etc.
Thought for 6 seconds
I get where you're coming from, DJ. It can feel like the perfect AI assistant—one that remembers your every task, tracks your kitchen stock, monitors your PC room gadgets, and even nudges you about warranty dates—is still a myth. But here’s the twist: while there isn’t one magical, all-encompassing AI yet, there are plenty of innovative tools pushing the envelope.

Imagine this: a future where an AI not only reminds you to buy milk before it turns but also updates you when that fancy new gadget’s warranty is about to expire. Right now, we have apps like Grocy or HomeZada that help manage home inventories, and productivity tools like Any.do or ClickUp Brain that can tackle tasks and reminders. They’re like stars in a still-forming constellation—each brilliant in its own right but not yet merged into a single, seamless galaxy of home management.

So while it might seem that “no AI can do it all” at present, the landscape is rapidly evolving. Big players are already integrating AI for supply chain and inventory tasks in the enterprise world (think Microsoft’s Copilot Studio and even Amazon’s Amelia), and the same innovations will eventually trickle down into personal life. Until then, you might need to mix and match a few apps to cover your bases—but rest assured, the AI revolution is only gathering momentum.

In short: your dream AI assistant is on the horizon, and every day brings us a little closer to that perfect blend of efficiency and ease. For now, a bit of ingenuity (and maybe a few sticky notes) will have to do the trick!

So creating one or atleast try won't be an issue?
Thought for a second
Absolutely—building (or at least experimenting with) your own AI assistant for managing tasks and inventory is very much within reach. With a plethora of open-source frameworks, APIs, and even dedicated platforms (think Grocy for inventory, or tools like Microsoft’s Copilot Studio that simplify agent creation), you can definitely give it a shot. It might require some creative tinkering and piecing together a few specialized tools, but in today’s tech landscape, it’s more like assembling a digital Lego set than reinventing the wheel. So go ahead—try building one and let your innovation lead the way!

Provide some tools and frameworks this will be hosted locally and on a low powered device
Reasoned for 29 seconds
DJ, absolutely—creating a local AI personal assistant on a low-powered device is totally doable, provided you choose the right lightweight tools. Here are some suggestions:

Machine Learning & Inference:

TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile: These are designed for resource-constrained devices (like a Raspberry Pi) and can run your trained models efficiently.
ONNX Runtime: A great alternative if you want to run models converted into the ONNX format.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Rasa Open Source: A robust framework for building conversational AI that can be hosted locally without the overhead of cloud services.
Alternatively, lightweight libraries like spaCy (with custom pipelines) can be tuned for NLU tasks.
Speech Recognition & Text-to-Speech:

Coqui STT (formerly Mozilla’s DeepSpeech) or PocketSphinx: These offer offline, low-resource speech-to-text capabilities.
For text-to-speech, consider eSpeak or Festival; they’re not as natural-sounding as cloud solutions but perfect for a low-powered, local setup.
Local Web Server & API:

Flask or FastAPI: Both are lightweight Python frameworks ideal for hosting your assistant’s backend and exposing RESTful endpoints.
Voice Assistant Platforms:

Mycroft AI or Rhasspy: Open-source voice assistant frameworks specifically designed to run offline on devices like the Raspberry Pi. They offer modularity and community support, making them perfect for a DIY project.
Local Data Storage:

SQLite: A minimal and efficient database solution that works great on low-powered hardware for storing user data, preferences, or conversation logs.
These tools, when combined, give you a powerful, yet lean, system that can operate locally without needing heavy cloud resources. It's like building your own mini digital butler—resourceful, self-sufficient, and ready to serve without breaking a sweat!

Great now for inventory and task management. This'll be called angry wife with a photographic memory. If I say I baught this there for this amount then. Or got for free by whomever or traded for what. What do I need to fix where. What components needs to be baught first and how much. Will I have spare change. Can I upload a slip and it grabs the data from it. So I can ask do we have to make that.

This is the base line I'm looking at
Reasoned for 19 seconds
Here’s a playful plan for "Angry Wife with a Photographic Memory" that’s both robust and light on resources:

Backend & API:
• Use a lightweight web framework like Flask or FastAPI to run your local server on a low-powered device (think Raspberry Pi).
• Store all your inventory, task data, and purchase details in a compact SQLite database.

Receipt Scanning & OCR:
• Integrate Tesseract OCR (via the Python wrapper pytesseract) to extract data from uploaded slips.
• For improved accuracy, use OpenCV to pre-process receipt images (adjust contrast, crop, etc.) before OCR.

Natural Language & Query Handling:
• Use Rasa Open Source or even a lightweight spaCy pipeline to parse and understand your voice/text commands (like “Do we have to make that?”).
• This lets you track when you said, “I bought this for X amount” or “got it free/traded for Y” and then ask intelligent follow‐up questions.

Task & Inventory Management:
• For the inventory side, consider adapting open-source tools (like Grocy) as inspiration—but with a twist tailored to your quirky “angry wife” vision.
• Build a simple web-based dashboard (using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap) to list items, track repairs, plan component purchases, and even check if you’ll have spare change.

Additional Considerations:
• If you’d like voice interactivity, lightweight solutions like PocketSphinx for offline speech-to-text can be added.
• Keep the overall stack minimal so it runs efficiently on low-powered hardware.

In short, your system will let you say, “I bought this for X,” snap a pic of your receipt (or upload a slip), and then later ask, “Do we need to fix that?”—with the AI pulling all the details like a photographic memory on steroids. It's a DIY inventory and task management solution that’s both resource-friendly and smart enough to keep track of every quirky purchase and repair need.

Happy building—and may your inventory be as sharp as your wit!

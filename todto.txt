Plan:

Enhance Natural Language Processing:

[] nlu_processor.py
[] Add machine learning models for intent classification and entity recognition
[] Improve pattern matching with more sophisticated NLP techniques
[] Add support for context-aware conversations
Expand Optical Character Recognition:

[] ocr_processor.py
[] Implement advanced image preprocessing techniques
[] Add support for different receipt formats and languages
[] Integrate with external OCR APIs for improved accuracy
Create New AI Components:

[] ai_models/
[] Create directory for storing trained models
[] Add model training scripts
[] data_processor.py
[] Create new module for data preprocessing and feature engineering
Update Main Application:

[] main.py
[] Integrate enhanced AI components
[] Add new API endpoints for AI features
Update Testing:

[] tests/test_nlu_processor.py
[] Add tests for new NLP features
[] tests/test_ocr_processor.py
[] Create new test file for OCR enhancements
[] tests/test_ai_models.py
[] Create new test file for AI model functionality
Dependent Files to be edited:

requirements.txt: Add new AI/ML dependencies
scripts/install_deps.py: Update to handle new dependencies
README.md: Document new AI features

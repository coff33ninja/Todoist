Plan:

Enhance Natural Language Processing:

[] nlu_processor.py
[] Add machine learning models for intent classification and entity recognition
[] Improve pattern matching with more sophisticated NLP techniques
[] Add support for context-aware conversations

Create New AI Components:
[] ai_models/
[] Create directory for storing trained models
[] Add model training scripts
[] data_processor.py
[] Create new module for data preprocessing and feature engineering

-Almost happy with end results-
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Expand Optical Character Recognition:

[] ocr_processor.py
[] Implement advanced image preprocessing techniques
[] Add support for different receipt formats and languages
[] Integrate with external OCR APIs for improved accuracy
-Current implementations:
Integrate Tesseract OCR for extracting data from receipts, allowing users to upload receipts and automatically log purchases.
 curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload_receipt -F 
 curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload_receipt -F "file=@../uploads/sample_receipt_international.txt"-


Update Main Application:

[] main.py
[] Integrate enhanced AI components
[] Add new API endpoints for AI features
-still in progress as more api's are being added and tested-
Update Testing:

[] tests/test_nlu_processor.py
[] Add tests for new NLP features
[] tests/test_ocr_processor.py
[] Create new test file for OCR enhancements
[] tests/test_ai_models.py
[] Create new test file for AI model functionality


Task and Inventory Management Features:
Develop features for tracking warranty dates, repair schedules, and maintenance reminders.
Implement a system for logging trades, gifts, and free acquisitions.

Budget Tracking Enhancements:
I need to add functionality to track spending against a budget and provide alerts when nearing budget limits.

User-Friendly Dashboard:
I need to create a web-based dashboard for users to view inventory, track tasks, and manage budgets visually.

Voice Interaction:
I am considering integration of voice recognition capabilities for hands-free interaction with the system.

Scenario-Based Training Data:
Use the scenarios outlined in the conversation.txt as training data I got from OpenAi (that led to the idea of this agent/assistant/angry house wife[who also was the route cause of this rabbit hole]) to improve the model's understanding of user queries and context.
More types of scenarios will be added for training.

Integration with External APIs:
I am going to explore the possibility of integrating with external services for enhanced functionality, such as price comparison or warranty tracking.

-Almost happy with end results-
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Expand Optical Character Recognition:

[] ocr_processor.py
[] Implement advanced image preprocessing techniques
[] Add support for different receipt formats and languages
[] Integrate with external OCR APIs for improved accuracy
-Current implementations:
Integrate Tesseract OCR for extracting data from receipts, allowing users to upload receipts and automatically log purchases.
 curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload_receipt -F 
 curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload_receipt -F "file=@../uploads/sample_receipt_international.txt"-


Update Main Application:

[] main.py
[] Integrate enhanced AI components
[] Add new API endpoints for AI features
-still in progress as more api's are being added and tested-
Update Testing:

[] tests/test_nlu_processor.py
[] Add tests for new NLP features
[] tests/test_ocr_processor.py
[] Create new test file for OCR enhancements
[] tests/test_ai_models.py
[] Create new test file for AI model functionality


Task and Inventory Management Features:
Develop features for tracking warranty dates, repair schedules, and maintenance reminders.
Implement a system for logging trades, gifts, and free acquisitions.

Budget Tracking Enhancements:
I need to add functionality to track spending against a budget and provide alerts when nearing budget limits.

User-Friendly Dashboard:
I need to create a web-based dashboard for users to view inventory, track tasks, and manage budgets visually.

Voice Interaction:
I am considering integration of voice recognition capabilities for hands-free interaction with the system.

Scenario-Based Training Data:
Use the scenarios outlined in the conversation.txt as training data I got from OpenAi (that led to the idea of this agent/assistant/angry house wife[who also was the route cause of this rabbit hole]) to improve the model's understanding of user queries and context.
More types of scenarios will be added for training.

Integration with External APIs:
I am going to explore the possibility of integrating with external services for enhanced functionality, such as price comparison or warranty tracking.

Project Plan: Enhanced System Implementation
Objective
To enhance the system by expanding the database schema, conversation types, contextual questions, styling, interactions, and data storage, thereby improving its utility for tracking and managing items.
1. Expanded Database Schema
Tasks:
Design New Tables:
Create tables for conditions, acquisition types, and maintenance records.
Define relationships between new and existing tables to support complex queries.
Extend Item History:
Add fields for detailed item attributes such as warranty and maintenance schedule.
Outcome:
A robust database schema that supports comprehensive item tracking and management.
2. Enhanced Conversation Types
Tasks:
Implement Transaction Types:
Develop conversation flows for:
Receiving items (gifts, etc.)
Purchasing items
Finding items
Borrowing/Renting
Inheriting items
Trading items
Making items
Winning items
Disposing/Donating items
Lost items
Develop Contextual Questions:
Create specific questions for each transaction type to gather relevant information:
Purchased items: Where bought, price, warranty info
Found items: Where found, ownership verification
Borrowed items: From whom, duration, return date
Inherited items: From whom, documentation
Traded items: With whom, what was traded
Made items: Materials used, time spent
Won items: Where won, contest details
Lost/Disposed items: Last seen, circumstances, reason
Outcome:
A comprehensive set of conversation types and contextual questions that enhance user interaction and data collection.
3. Enhanced Styling and Interactions
Tasks:
Implement Visual Feedback:
Design UI components that provide clear visual cues for user actions.
Create Clickable Examples:
Develop examples that users can click to understand how to interact with the system.
Outcome:
An intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances user experience.
4. Data Storage
Tasks:
Implement Comprehensive Item History:
Store detailed records of item history, including maintenance and ownership changes.
Track Maintenance Records:
Implement logic to track maintenance schedules and records.
Implement Ownership Tracking:
Keep a log of ownership changes and related documentation.
Record Location History:
Store data on where items have been located over time.
Monitor Condition Changes:
Record changes in item condition.
Store Transaction Details:
Save detailed information about each transaction.
Outcome:
A robust data storage system that supports detailed tracking and management of items.
5. Testing and Validation
Tasks:
Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Validate that the system handles all scenarios and collects the necessary information.
Outcome:
A reliable and error-free system ready for deployment.
6. Documentation and Training
Tasks:
Document the system's features and provide training materials for users.
Ensure users understand how to interact with the system and utilize its features effectively.
Outcome:
Well-documented system with trained users who can effectively use the enhanced features.
